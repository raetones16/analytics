# Project Documentation

This `docs/` folder is the central place for all project documentation, including implementation plans, technical decisions, and ongoing notes for major features such as integrations, data processing, and user experience.

## Purpose

- Capture the current state and future plans for the project.
- Document technical approaches, architecture, and design decisions.
- Provide clear implementation steps and references for ongoing and future work.
- Support collaboration and onboarding of new contributors.

## Structure

- Each major feature or area (e.g., integrations) should have its own subfolder and README.
- Living documents: Please update documentation as decisions are made and implementation progresses.

## Getting Started

- Start by reading the relevant README in each subfolder (e.g., `integrations/README.md`).
- Add new documents as needed for new features, RFCs, or technical notes.

## Contribution

- Keep documentation up to date as you work on the project.
- Reference this folder in code reviews and planning discussions.
