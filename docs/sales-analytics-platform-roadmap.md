# Sales Analytics Platform - Comprehensive Roadmap

## **Platform Vision**

A comprehensive analytics dashboard that started with local file processing and is evolving into a B2B SaaS analytics platform. The platform currently supports local CSV/Excel file processing with hard-coded charts, and is being enhanced with live Salesforce integration, automatic syncing, and dynamic chart creation for board reporting and business intelligence.

## **Current Implementation Status** ‚úÖ

### **Foundation System (Working)**

1. **Local File Processing** - CSV/Excel file reading and processing
2. **Hard-coded Analytics Dashboard** - Product usage, sales performance, customer satisfaction
3. **Date Range Filtering** - Monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly views
4. **Multi-source Data** - Salesforce exports, ChurnZero reports, Support Portal data
5. **Responsive UI** - Clean, functional dashboard interface

### **Live Integration Enhancement (Recently Completed)**

1. **Salesforce OAuth PKCE Integration** - Secure authentication flow
2. **Automatic Syncing** - Configurable frequency (manual, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
3. **Field Selection UI** - Dynamic loading of Salesforce objects and fields
4. **Manual Sync** - On-demand data synchronization
5. **Database Schema** - Complete with sync scheduling and field selection storage
6. **API Endpoints** - Full CRUD operations for integrations, syncing, and field management
7. **Security** - Environment variable storage for credentials, Bearer token auth for cron

### **Technical Architecture**

**Current Foundation:**

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Processing**: File reading utilities for Excel/CSV
- **Charts**: Hard-coded visualizations with date filtering
- **Storage**: Local file system (`data/` directory)

**Live Integration Enhancement:**

- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Data Pipeline**: Meltano + Singer (tap-salesforce, target-jsonl)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow
- **Deployment**: Vercel with cron jobs

## **Analytics Capabilities** üìä

### **Current (Local File Processing)**

- **Product Usage**: Web app logins, mobile app usage, timesheet submissions
- **Sales Performance**: Deal amounts, close dates, module sales from Salesforce exports
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Support tickets, NPS scores, priority tracking
- **Date Filtering**: Flexible time period analysis

### **Enhanced (Live Integration)**

- **Real-time Sales Metrics**: Live Salesforce data without manual exports
- **Revenue Analytics**: ARR growth, deal values, pipeline health
- **Client Analytics**: Active clients, new acquisitions, churn tracking
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Average order value, sales cycle length, conversion rates

### **Target KPIs for Board Reporting**

- **Deal Performance**: Net won deals, lost deals, win rate
- **Revenue Metrics**: Average ARR per deal, total ARR growth, total sales value
- **Client Analytics**: Total active clients, new client acquisition, churn rate
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Average order value, average modules per client
- **Pipeline Health**: Conversion rates, sales cycle length, forecast accuracy

### **Reporting Periods**

- **Current**: Monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly
- **Future**: Custom date ranges
- **Historical**: Target 3-5 years, minimum 12 months

## **Current Challenge: Salesforce Object Overload** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **The Problem**

- Salesforce returns 1099+ objects (standard + custom + system objects)
- Only ~10-15 objects are relevant for sales analytics
- Current UI shows first 10 objects with "1099 more available" - overwhelming for users
- No categorization or search functionality

### **Impact on User Experience**

- Users can't find relevant objects (Opportunity, Account, Contact, etc.)
- No guidance on which objects contain the data they need
- Technical complexity exposed to business users

## **Proposed Solutions** üí°

### **1. Smart Object Filtering**

```
Core Sales Objects (Always Show):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Opportunity (deals, revenue, close dates)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account (companies, client data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact (people, decision makers)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lead (prospects, pipeline)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User (sales reps, ownership)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Product2 (products/services sold)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityLineItem (deal line items, ARR)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Campaign (marketing attribution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Case (customer success, support)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Task/Event (activities, touchpoints)

Filter Out:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ System objects (RecordType, Profile, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Metadata objects (CustomObject__mdt, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Irrelevant standard objects (Document, Folder, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Most custom objects (unless explicitly selected)
```

### **2. Enhanced UX Features**

- **Search functionality** - Find objects by name or description
- **Object categorization** - Group by Sales, Marketing, Support, etc.
- **Popular objects first** - Show most commonly used objects at top
- **Object descriptions** - Explain what each object contains
- **Field recommendations** - Suggest key fields for each object

### **3. Pre-built Templates**

```
Sales Performance Template:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Opportunity: Amount, CloseDate, StageName, Probability
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account: Name, Type, Industry, AnnualRevenue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact: Name, Title, Email, AccountId
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityLineItem: UnitPrice, Quantity, Product2Id

Board Reporting Template:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Focus on ARR, deal metrics, client counts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Time-based fields for trend analysis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Key performance indicators
```

## **Historical Data Strategy** üìä

### **Salesforce Timestamp Fields**

Most Salesforce objects have built-in date tracking:

- `CreatedDate` - When record was created
- `LastModifiedDate` - When record was last updated
- `CloseDate` - When opportunity was closed (Opportunity)
- `LastActivityDate` - Last activity on account/contact

### **Approaches for Historical Analysis**

#### **Option 1: Date-Based Filtering (Simplest)**

- Use existing Salesforce date fields
- Filter data by date ranges in queries
- Pros: Simple, uses existing data
- Cons: Limited to creation/modification dates

#### **Option 2: Incremental Syncing with Snapshots**

- Sync data regularly and store historical snapshots
- Build data warehouse with time-series tables
- Pros: True historical state tracking
- Cons: More complex, requires more storage

#### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

- Use Salesforce date fields for basic trends
- Implement incremental syncing for critical metrics
- Store monthly/quarterly snapshots for board reporting
- Pros: Balanced complexity vs. functionality

### **Data Retention Strategy**

- **Real-time**: Last 30 days (detailed sync)
- **Monthly snapshots**: 3-5 years
- **Quarterly summaries**: Indefinite
- **Annual reports**: Indefinite

## **Scalability Considerations** üöÄ

### **Current Scale**

- 1200 clients
- Single Salesforce org
- Monthly/quarterly reporting

### **Future Multi-Tenant Vision**

- Multiple businesses using the platform
- Various CRM integrations (HubSpot, Pipedrive, etc.)
- Different industry verticals
- White-label capabilities

### **Technical Scaling Challenges**

1. **API Rate Limits**

   - Salesforce: 15,000 API calls/24hrs (typical)
   - Need intelligent batching and caching

2. **Data Volume**

## **Key Questions for Next Conversation**

1. **Object Filtering Priority**: Should we start with a hardcoded whitelist or build a dynamic filtering system?

2. **Historical Data Approach**: Date-based filtering first, or jump straight to incremental syncing?

3. **UI/UX Focus**: Search functionality vs. categorization vs. templates - which first?

4. **Performance vs. Features**: Should we optimize current implementation before adding new features?

5. **Multi-tenant Timeline**: When do we need to start considering multi-tenant architecture?

This roadmap provides a comprehensive foundation for your next conversation and future development phases.
